# Turing-Exhaustion

This code provides exhastive enumeration for the article "Identifying Network Topologies That Can Generate Turing Pattern" written by M. Mocarlo Zheng, et al., 2016.

This code is only permitted for non-commercial use and should be referenced or acknowledged once being adapted for supporting any publication.

The code need to be compiled by typing "make" on the command line under Unix, and GSL is required before compiling.

To be sorry, there's still not many annotations in the original code, and we'll try developing it in the future.
